# Project 2 - Custom Top Implementation

The goal of this project is to implement a `top(1)`-like command for gleaning
information about a Linux system. For a general idea of the type of program
you'll implement, try running the real `top` executable on an Alamode machine.
You'll see something like the following that refreshes every so often:

```

 ```

If you want to see what's going on under the hood on each refresh cycle, try
running this command on an Alamode machine:

`strace top -b -n 1  > /dev/null`


## Building and running the program

To build the main program (called 'mytop' by default), type:

`make`

To both build and run the program, use:

`make run`

For this starter code, I did my best to ensure that `make` knows all about the
dependencies for all of the code. So, if you change a file, re-running `make`
should rebuild everything with your changes. You shouldn't need to run
`make clean` at all, though you can if you want.


## Running the tests

To run the unit tests, type:

`make test`

The first time you run the tests after cloning the code, you'll be prompted to
initialize the `googletest` submodule. If you typically access GitHub
via HTTPS rather than SSH, you'll need to update the URL in the `.gitmodules`
file prior to this step. The following command will set up the `googletest`
submodule so that you're ready to run the tests:

`git submodule update --init`

The tests run using a snapshot of the `proc` filesystem that I took from
bb136-21. It's included in the repository as `proc.tar.bz2`, which is a
compressed archive. Using `make test` should automatically decompress and
unarchive this snapshot and make it available via a symlink in the root of your
repository. The tests are compiled so that they `#define PROC_ROOT = ./proc`,
while your real binary will be compiled so that it uses the real proc (`/proc`).

On Alamode machines, the snapshot is unarchived under `/dev/shm`, which is an
in-memory file system. Since it's in memory, it's really fast. Your home
directory on Alamode machines is on a file server somewhere (not local to the
machine), so it's really really slow. On a personal computer, the snapshot is
simply placed in your `$TMPDIR`. It's not as fast as an in-memory file system, but
at least it's not on some remote file server.

The snapshot is also available as a repository here:

https://github.com/csm-csci442/proc-snapshot


## Running specific tests

If you're working on implementing a specific feature, you can filter the tests
that get run to just the ones of interest.

For example, to only show tests in the `GetMemoryInfo` suite (which includes all
the tests for `memory_info_tests.cpp`), you could run the following:

`make test TEST_FILTER=GetMemoryInfo.*`

If you want to run just a single test (like `GetMemoryInfo.FreeMemory`), you
could run the following:

`make test TEST_FILTER=GetMemoryInfo.FreeMemory`

## File structure

Unlike the starter code for the last project, all of the source code for this
project lives under the `src` directory. All build artifacts are placed under a
generated `bin` directory, except for the final executable, which is placed
under the repository root.

Under the `src` directory:

  - `src/info` - Classes and tests that deal with retrieving data from the
    `/proc` filesystem. This should be the only directory you need to modify for
    the first deliverable. Any code that reads from the proc file system should
    go in here.

  - `src/utils` - Directory where you can place any files containing utility
    classes. You can also add your own unit tests here, and they should be 
    automatically included in the `make test` target. My implementation had
    these additional files under this directory (though you don't have to do the
    same):

    - `src/utils/flags.{h,cpp}` - Code for defining and parsing command-line
       flags via getopt.

    - `src/utils/sort_functions.{h,cpp}` - Code defining comparator functions
      for ordering processes by PID, memory usage, CPU usage, and time running.

    - `src/utils/statistics.{h,cpp}` - Code related to performing calculations
      like determining CPU utilization (there aren't too many calculations to
      do).

    - `src/utils/formatting.{h,cpp}` - Code to help with formatting numbers in
      readable formats, e.g. human-readably bytes (B, KiB, MiB, GiB, etc) and
      time strings (seconds, minutes, hours, days, etc).

  - `src/*` (including `main.cpp`) - Any code you place directly under the `src`
    directory will be compiled slightly differently by default: NCURSES will be
    linked in, and unit tests placed here will not be included in `make test`.
    Any NCURSES code you add (such as calls to `printw` and `timeout`) should go
    at this level.

I also added tests for my classes under `src/utils`. This is completely
optional, but the infrastructure is all set up if you want to add some of your
own. Unit tests are a great way to prove to yourself that your code is working
like it should. Use the existing tests as examples, and you'll see that they're
not very hard to do.


## Coding on a Mac

You can build this program on a Mac, but since the `/proc` filesystem is a Linux
construct, your finished product won't work correctly under OS X. That doesn't
mean you can't do much of your work on your Mac, though.

All of deliverable 1, which is simply getting unit tests to pass, is feasible.
Likewise, since much of your work for the final deliverable is just displaying
data, you can work with fake data to get things looking right. Unfortunately,
once you're ready to test your program for real, you'll need to work on a Linux
machine.

As always, you need to check that your program compiles and runs on Alamode
machines prior to submitting them.


## Final thoughts

Start early and ask questions!

...or not. I'm a sign, not a cop. =)
